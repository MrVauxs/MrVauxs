# Hi! I'm Vauxs

> Also commonly known with other prefixes such as _Mr_, _Sir_, or _That_ Vauxs.

You can see everything I made over at [my website](https://mrvauxs.net/). But to summarize, I create content for [Foundry VTT](foundryvtt.com).

As you may notice from the packages above, I am a fan of Pathfinder 2e. I also maintain [PF2eTools](https://pf2etools.com/), and I am working on a new version of the site using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/).

Beyond that, I studied American Studies, I like art as well as commissioning it, and I like music of wide varieties of genres. Can't say what are my favourites though by any particular genre.

Hope you like my content!
