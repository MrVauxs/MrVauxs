# Hi!

I'm MrVauxs. I create content for [Foundry VTT](foundryvtt.com). You can see my packages [here](https://foundryvtt.com/community/mrvauxs/packages), though that does not include commissions that I made such as ones for the [Botanical Bestiary](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/428111/The-Botanical-Bestiary-Foundry-Module), or [Loot Tavern](https://loottavern.com/shop/?ixwpst[product_cat][]=116&title=1&excerpt=1&content=1&categories=1&attributes=1&tags=1&sku=1&ixwpsf[taxonomy][product_cat][show]=all&ixwpsf[taxonomy][product_cat][multiple]=1&ixwpsf[taxonomy][product_cat][filter]=1)!

As you may notice from the packages above, I am a fan of Pathfinder 2e. I also maintain [PF2eTools](https://pf2etools.com/), and I am working on a new version of the site using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/).

Beyond that, I like art and commissioning it, and music of wide varieties of genres. Can't say what are my favourites though by any particular genre.

Hope you like my content!
